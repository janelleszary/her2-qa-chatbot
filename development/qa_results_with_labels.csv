What percentage of tumors showed HER-2/neu amplification?,30% of the tumors showed HER-2/neu amplification.,HER-2/neu was amplified in approximately 30% of the tumors.,0.5,0.3333333333333333,0.9018151164054871,hit
What is the molecular weight of the HER-2/neu protein?,"185,000 daltons","The HER-2/neu protein is 185,000 daltons.",0.25,0.5357142857142857,0.5524008870124817,hit
How does HER-2/neu copy number relate to survival times?,"The study shows that an increased copy number of the HER-2/neu gene is associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival times. Specifically, patients with greater than five copies of HER-2/neu had even shorter disease-free survival times (P = 0.015) and overall survival times (P = 0.06) compared to patients with no amplification.",Patients with greater than five copies of HER-2/neu had shorter disease-free and overall survival times.,0.44776119402985076,0.46846846846846846,0.896350622177124,hit
What is the incidence rate of EGFR amplification compared to HER-2/neu?,"The incidence rate of EGFR amplification is 14 times lower than that of HER-2/neu, as indicated by the study. Specifically, EGFR amplification was found in 4 out of 189 cases (2%), while HER-2/neu amplification was found in 53 out of 189 cases (28%).","EGFR amplification was found in 2% of tumors, whereas HER-2/neu was amplified in about 28â€“30%, making HER-2/neu amplification 14 times more common.",0.27692307692307694,0.3677581863979849,0.8868681192398071,hit
How does HER-2/neu compare to estrogen receptor status in prognosis?,"In lymph node-positive disease, amplification of HER-2/neu has greater prognostic value than hormonal-receptor status (such as estrogen receptor).",HER-2/neu amplification had greater prognostic value than estrogen receptor status in lymph node-positive breast cancer.,0.6666666666666666,0.5112781954887218,0.892343282699585,hit
What makes HER-2/neu different from EGFR at the molecular level?,"At the molecular level, HER-2/neu differs from EGFR in several ways. Firstly, it is found on band q21 of chromosome 17, while EGFR is located on band p11-p13 of chromosome 7. Secondly, although both proteins have an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain, HER-2/neu has two cysteine-rich repeat clusters in its transmembrane domain that are not present in EGFR. Lastly, while HER-2/neu is related to EGFR, it is distinct from it within the erbB-like oncogene family.","HER-2/neu is located on chromosome 17q21 and encodes a 185 kDa protein, while EGFR is on chromosome 7p11-13 and encodes a 170 kDa protein. Their mRNA sizes also differ.",0.1651376146788991,0.2603550295857988,0.8991223573684692,hit
What method was used to assess gene amplification?,The study used dilution analysis and soft laser densitometry scanning to assess gene amplification of HER-2/neu in the samples.,Southern blot analysis was used to assess gene amplification using radiolabeled HER-2/neu probes.,0.4375,0.5803571428571429,0.718096911907196,partial
How was DNA prepared and visualized in this study?,"In this study, DNA was prepared from individual tumors as described, digested with Eco RI enzyme, and subjected to Southern blot analysis. The DNA was then visualized by hybridizing it with a 32P-labeled HER-2/neu probe and a 32P-labeled arginase gene probe for normalization purposes.","DNA was digested with Eco RI, run on agarose gels, transferred to nylon filters, and hybridized with radiolabeled probes for autoradiography.",0.24615384615384614,0.4225352112676056,0.5853832960128784,hit
What was the p-value for the correlation between HER-2/neu amplification and relapse?,The study provides a P value of <0.0001 for the correlation between HER-2/neu amplification and time to disease relapse.,"The correlation between HER-2/neu amplification and time to relapse was highly significant, with a p-value of <0.0001.",0.5555555555555555,0.5714285714285714,0.9138405919075012,hit
